# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

[This project is to learn the best way to use Claude, specifically, plugin, agents, skills, and mcps.]

## Architecture

[High-level architectural overview explaining the major components and how they interact. Focus on:
- Key modules/packages and their responsibilities
- Data flow and how components communicate
- Important design patterns or architectural decisions
- Entry points to the codebase]

Example structure:
```
src/
  components/     - React components
  services/       - Business logic and API calls
  utils/          - Shared utilities
  state/          - State management (Redux, Context, etc.)
tests/            - Test suites
```

## Development Setup
